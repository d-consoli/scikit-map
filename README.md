eumap is a library to enable easier access to EU environmental maps and functions to produce and improve new value-added spatial layers.
It implements efficient spatial and spatiotemporal overlay, High Performance Computing, extends the Ensemble Machine Learning algorithms developed within the [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) framework.
eumap builds upon various existing softare, especially on GDAL, R and Python packages for spatial analysis and Machine Learning libraries.

pyeumap Workflow 
-------

![pyeumap Workflow](img/pyeumap_workflow.png)

The workflow implemented by pyeumap 1) fills all the gaps for different remote sensing time-series, 2) does the space time overlay of point samples on several raster layers according to the reference date, 3) trains and evaluate a machine learning model, and 4) does the space time predictions for a specific target variable. These processing steps are [demonstrated ](demo/python) using a [benchmark dataset for land-cover classification](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4058447) in different areas of the EU

This image presents the output of the gap filing approach for an area located in Croatia (tile 9529). This image refers to a Landsat temporal composites for the 2010 fall season, however all the 4 seasons since 2000 were analysed to fill the gaps.

This animation shows the land-cover classes for an area located in Sweden (tile 22497) according to the space time predictions. This example is a small use case that used 680 point samples, obtained in different years, to train a single model and to predict the land-cover in the region over the time.
