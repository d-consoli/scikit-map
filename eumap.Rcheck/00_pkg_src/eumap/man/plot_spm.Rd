\title{Plot Spatial Matrix,}
\usage{
plot_spm(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  z = NULL,
  Vim = NULL,
  main = NULL,
  palet = NULL,
  colorcut = NULL,
  xbins = 60,
  gtype = c("accuracy", "correlation", "var.imp"),
  gmode = c("root", "log10", "norm", "log2", "nat"),
  aspect = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object that contains observational data, if x <= 500 observation, then `plot_spm` generates a density plot, regardless of the other arguments that is passed,}

\item{y}{Object that contains predicted data,}

\item{z}{Object that contains top variable importance values to be used in partial dependency plot,}

\item{Vim}{Object that contains named numeric variable importance,}

\item{main}{Title of the plot,}

\item{palet}{Default values is palet=colorRampPalette(c("wheat2","yellow" ,"red","red3","orchid","orchid4),}

\item{colorcut}{Default value is colorcut = c(0,0.01,0.03,0.07,0.15,0.25,0.5,0.75,1) ,}

\item{xbins}{Number of bins, default value is 50,}

\item{gtype}{Graphical type; user can choose among: gtype = c("accuracy", "correlation","var.imp")."accuracy" provides accuracy plot for a regression matrix. "correlation" provides partial correlation plot for the regression matrix. "var.imp" provides a graph of top 10 percent of the most informative features,}

\item{gmode}{Graphical mode; in case `gtype=accuracy` gives user five options for representation of the accuracy plot as following: c("root","log10","norm","log2","nat"). "root" shows root square representation of the data,"norm" represent normalized representation of the data, "nat" represent natural  representation of the data,}

\item{aspect}{Default values is aspect = 1,}

\item{...}{Other arguments that can be passed on to \code{hexbin}.}
