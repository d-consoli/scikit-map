EUMAP LIBRARY
##################

Eumap is a library to enable easier access to several **spatial layers prepared for Continental Europe** (*Landsat and Sentinel mosaics, DTM and climate datasets, land cover, potential natural vegetation and environmental quality maps*), as well the processing workflows used to produce them. 

It implements efficient **raster access** through `rasterio <https://rasterio.readthedocs.io>`_, multiple **gapfiling** approaches, **spatial and spacetime overlay**, **training samples** preparation (LUCAS points), and **Ensemble Machine Learning** applied to spatial predictions (fully compatible with `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_).

The spatial layers can be accessed through `ODSE Viewer <http://maps.opendatascience.eu>`_.
